## Stacks and abilities 💻

In this project, React Router, component lifecycle, asynchronous JavaScript, and a lot of CSS were heavily explored. No style library was used, so far, to explore and solidify understanding of CSS3 and new features that are still being tested on some browsers.

A good amount of time was spent making the application responsive on different types of devices, as shown in the video.

## Feats in development 🚧

I'm currently working on the game itself, so the user can play against the machine. Watch this repository to keep track of it.
